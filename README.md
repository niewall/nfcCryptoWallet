# nfcCryptoWallet
With this app, you can write paper wallets on NFC Tags, read them and get the balance and actual worth in USD.
It also displays the public key as an QR-Code after reading and can read QR-Codes too.
At the moment bitcoin and ZCash are supportet. I plan to add Monero in the not so distant future.
Balance an price is received via API services.

The only problem, besides some bugs, is that anybody who can read an NFC-Tag the normal way, can get the private key quiet easily.
Implied this person knows where the NFC-Tag is and that there is a crypto wallet on it.
Because they are very tiny and some are very thin, they can be hidden on many places and are keeping the information theoretically forever, unless they get dameged.

I placed one behind a painting of an bitcoin I made one day. Now I can store my bitcoin in a painting and read the worth by holding my phone
in front of it. Thats quiet cool, isn't it?
