# nfcCryptoWallet
With this app, you can write paper wallets on NFC Tags, read them and get the balance and actual worth in USD.
It also displays the public key as an QR-Code after reading and can read QR-Codes too.
At the moment bitcoin and ZCash are supported. I plan to add Monero in the not so distant future.
Balance and price is received via API services.
